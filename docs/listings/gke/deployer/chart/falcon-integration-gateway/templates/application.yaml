      Falcon Integration Gateway (FIG) forwards threat detection findings from CrowdStrike Falcon
      platform to the backend of your choice. This instance forwards detection findings to GCP
      Security Command Center.

      Detection findings generated by CrowdStrike Falcon platform inform you about suspicious files
      and behaviors in your environment. You will see detections on a range of activities from
      the presence of a bad file (indicator of compromise (IOC)) to a nuanced collection of suspicious
      behaviors (indicator of attack (IOA)) occurring on one of your hosts or containers. You can
      learn more about the individual detections in Falcon documentation.

      Falcon Integration Gateway (FIG) is an open source project, not CrowdStrike product.
      As such it carries no formal support, expressed or implied.

    notes: |-
      Falcon Integration Gateway is headless service that forwards findings from CrowdStrike Falcon to
      GCP Security Command Center.

      Detection findings generated by CrowdStrike Falcon platform inform you about suspicious files
      and behaviors in your environment. You will see detections on a range of activities from
      the presence of a bad file (indicator of compromise (IOC)) to a nuanced collection of suspicious
      behaviors (indicator of attack (IOA)) occurring on one of your hosts or containers. You can
      learn more about the individual detections in Falcon documentation.

      Detections will be reported in Security Command Center under Finding Source called "CrowdStrike Falcon".

      To verify the deployment you can generate sample detection. In order to generate sample detection,
      run the following command on a VM or Kubernetes cluster that has CrowdStrike Falcon sensor installed.

          chgrp 0 /etc/ld.so.preload
